# Music NFT Minting App

This is an application developed by Juan Villalobos (@juantonmusic) that allows musicians, artists and producers to mint their tracks as an NFT to be played back in the app. The idea is that artists can receive tips when you play their tracks and can sell their tracks directly to fans.

## Running the app locally

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Current Stories

- An artist or user can login to the page using their wallet
- an artist can open a create nft page
- an artist can upload their track file with artwork and preview the NFT before minting
- an artist will receive a warning before minting the NFT saying it is permanent
- An artist will see a transaction in progress while their NFT is being minted
- An artists will receive the NFT's they have minted

## Future Updates

This project uses a simple trello board to manage an agile build process with a kanban style workflow (backlog -> in progress -> done). You can see the exisiting [Trello board here](https://trello.com/b/aij0HW5j/music-nft-minting-app). If you would like to be added as a member to help support the agile build, please shoot me an email at [juan@juantonmusic.com](mailto:juan@juantonmusic.com).
